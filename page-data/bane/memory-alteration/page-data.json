The target does not know what happened during this time outside of the memories you feed them (including having seen you, if they did). Multiple uses of this bane progressively erase consecutive 5 minute increments.</li>\n<li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Instead of the immediate past, you can erase or alter memories from any time.</li>\n</ul>\nThe memory alteration bane can only be inflicted via a bane attack. Damaging attacks that trigger banes cannot trigger this bane.\nThis bane confers no special ability to know about a target's memory.
