A warrior might invoke this bane by hurling a boulder while a cyber hacker might achieve the same effect by uploading a hallucinatory virus into an opponent's neuro jack.\n","duration":"Special","effect":"On its turn, the afflicted target must use its entire turn to get as far away as possible from you. It cannot use its actions to do anything other than retreat, and it cannot willingly move closer to you while the bane persists.\n","invocationTime":"1 Major Action","name":"Fear","power":[5],"special":"While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist them, this bane prevents the target from thinking clearly. However, the target's logical mind fights to regain control. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from this effect. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next hour.\nWhen inflicting this bane using Might, you may determine range using the Non-Physical Attack Range table (see Chapter 7: Combat).\n","fields":{"slug":"/bane/fear"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bane/fear","name":"Fear"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3366224840"]}
