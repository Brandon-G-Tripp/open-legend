The GM has the final word on whether a proposed cure can help a given type of persistent damage, but the  following examples can help with arbitration:\n<ul>\n  <li>Bleeding damage is cured with a successful roll using Learning, Logic, or Creation.</li>\n  <li>Lightning damage is cured by a discharge or grounding of the current.</li>\n  <li>Cold damage is countered with warmth, heat, or fire.</li>\n  <li>Acid damage is neutralized with alkalizing agents (powder, milk, etc.).</li>\n  <li>Fire damage is neutralized with water or smothering.</li>\n  <li>Entropic damage is neutralized with extraordinary or magical healing.</li>\n</ul>\nThis bane may still be resisted in the usual way of using the resist banes action.\n","fields":{"slug":"/bane/persistent-damage"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bane/persistent-damage","name":"Persistent Damage"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3366224840"]}
